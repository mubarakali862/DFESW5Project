This is a spring boot project by Mubarak Ali.

Link to Jira Board: https://mubarakjirawebsite.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/PPDMA/boards/2

Why are we doing this?
We are doing this to learn springboot and learn how to build an API that is fully functional and capable of handling HTTP requests from postman and get the data to persist to a database. This is so that we can put together all the knowledge we have learned over the past 9 week in the core and the software specialism. This included using git, github, java mysql, h2, postman, jira and bringing them all together in an Agile manner.

How I expected the challenge to go?
I expected it to be a challenge and test how well I had learned the content of the course

What went well?/What didn't go as planned?
The overall project went as planned although the risk assessment was a bit challenging to do.

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project?
I would have done the erd diagram if revisted this in the future
